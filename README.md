# mail-script
When you send an email to someone, this service can send text notifications to them that they've just received an email.
Currently, there's functionality, for sending WhatsApp messages, using the WhatsApp Business API. I'm considering adding a Twilio-based auth to send SMS messages as well.
I would also explore setting it up for other mail clients as well - Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook, etc.
If you have any suggestions or comments, you can create an issue.
